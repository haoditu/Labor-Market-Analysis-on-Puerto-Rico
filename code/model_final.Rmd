We used data from the 2016 ACS for Puerto Rico to examine wage gaps between individuals with different education levels. Our research questions are:
1) How do earnings vary by education level?
2) How does the premium for education vary by gender?
The 2016 ACS is a nationally representative sample of `r nrow(ss16ppr)`. The household survey includes questions pertaining to each household memberâ€™s demographic characteristics and labor market activity. 

We restrict our sample to these three racial groups: White, Black and Other. In addition, given our goal of examining earning differences by gender and marital status and the reporting of earnings in the ACS on an annual basis (wages, salary, commissions, bonuses, tips, and self-employment income during the past 12 months), we restrict our sample to full-time year-round (FTYR) workers. We define FTYR workers as individuals who report positive earnings over the past year, who worked at least 40 of the past 52 weeks, and who worked at least 35 hours per week in a usual work week over this period. 

## EDA Insights: 

For our exploratory analysis we looked at population breakdowns by education, age,  marital status, gender, race, earnings, and work hours. We applied filters on education (HS diploma or above), age (18-64), and work hours (>35/week). 

An earnings histogram identified a default maximum amount of earnings (189k) which we also filtered out of the data. The earning distribution is progressive above the median, but drops off sharply below the median, likely indicating the presence of a minimum wage. The correlation between age and earnings is very weak (.23). Likewise, earnings is very weakly correlated with hours worked among those who work more than 35 hours per week. However, white individuals appear to have an earnings premium over other races, and both married and divorced individuals appear to have an earnings premium over those who have never been married. Given that the correlation between age and earnings was weak, this may be due to other qualitative factors possessed by those who get married.  Married was recategoried to married, divorced and never married.  Men also appear to earn a small premium over women.

The age distribution of full time workers is skewed towards older adults, possibly indicating that younger workers have trouble finding full-time work, wait to enter the workforce, or are leaving the territory.



## Preliminary Econometric Estimates

### First Model

$Earning = \beta_0 + Widowed * \beta_1 + Divorced * \beta_2 + Separated * \beta_3 + NeverMarried * \beta_4 + RaceBlack * \beta_5 + RaceOther * \beta_6 + SomeCollege * \beta_7 + Associate * \beta_8 + Bachelor * \beta_9 + Master * \beta_10 + Professional * \beta_11 + Doctoral * \beta_12 + Age * \beta_13 + Age * Age \beta_14$

### Stratified Model Gender

### Gender: Female

```{r}
ss16ppr_female <- ss16ppr %>% filter(Female == 1) %>% select(-Female)
ss16ppr_male <- ss16ppr %>% filter(Female == 0) %>% select(-Female)

model_1 <- lm(log(PERNP) ~ Widowed + Divorced + Separated + NeverMarried + RaceBlack + RaceOther + SomeCollege + Associate + Bachelor + Master + Professional + Doctoral + AGEP + I(AGEP * AGEP), data = ss16ppr_female)
summary(model_1)
#plot_model(model_1, type = "diag")
```

The model for women is robusted:

+ Controlling for race, education and age, married women earn on average about `r abs(round((exp(model_1$coefficients["Widowed"]) -1) * 100, 2))`% less than widowed women. The penalty associated with marriage is statistically significantly (p < .05). 
+ Controlling for race, education and age, married women earn on average about `r abs(round((exp(model_1$coefficients["Divorced"]) -1) * 100, 2))`% more than divorced women. The premium associated with marriage is not statistically significantly (p > .05). 
+ Controlling for race, education and age, married women earn on average about `r abs(round((exp(model_1$coefficients["Separated"]) -1) * 100, 2))`% more than separated women. The premium associated with marriage is not statistically significantly (p > .05). 
+ Controlling for race, education and age, married women earn on average about `r abs(round((exp(model_1$coefficients["NeverMarried"]) -1) * 100, 2))`% more than never married women. The premium associated with marriage is not statistically significantly (p > .05). 
+ Controlling for marriage, education and age, White women earn on average about `r abs(round((exp(model_1$coefficients["RaceBlack"]) -1) * 100, 2))`% more than Black women. The premium associated with raceBlack is not statistically significantly (p > .05). 
+ Controlling for marriage, education and age, White women earn on average about `r abs(round((exp(model_1$coefficients["RaceOther"]) -1) * 100, 2))`% more than Other race women. The premium associated with otherrace is statistically significantly (p < .05). 
+ Controlling for marriage, race and age, women have high school education earn on average about `r abs(round((exp(model_1$coefficients["SomeCollege"]) -1) * 100, 2))`% less than women have some college education. The penalty associated with education level is statistically significantly (p < .05). 
+ Controlling for marriage, race and age, women have high school education earn on average about `r abs(round((exp(model_1$coefficients["Associate"]) -1) * 100, 2))`% less than women have associate education. The penalty associated with education level is statistically significantly (p < .05). 
+ Controlling for marriage, race and age, women have high school education earn on average about `r abs(round((exp(model_1$coefficients["Bachelor"]) -1) * 100, 2))`% less than women have bachelorâ€™s degree. The penalty associated with education level is statistically significantly (p < .05). 
+ Controlling for marriage, race and age, women have high school education earn on average about `r abs(round((exp(model_1$coefficients["Master"]) -1) * 100, 2))`% less than women have masterâ€™s degree. The penalty associated with education level is statistically significantly (p < .05). 
+ Controlling for marriage, race and age, women have high school education earn on average about `r abs(round((exp(model_1$coefficients["Professional"]) -1) * 100, 2))`% less than women have Professional education. The penalty associated with education level is statistically significantly (p < .05). 
+ Controlling for marriage, race and age, women have high school education earn on average about `r abs(round((exp(model_1$coefficients["Doctoral"]) -1) * 100, 2))`% less than women have doctorâ€™s degree. The penalty associated with education level is statistically significantly (p < .05). 
+ In our subsample of female, predicted earnings increase at a decreasing rate within the age range of our sample, namely, 18 to 64 years. The average age for maximum earnings is `r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["AGEP"]/(2*model_1$coefficients["I(AGEP * AGEP)"]), 2))`. The coefficients on age is statistically significant, though its square is not statistically significant.

For men:

+ Controlling for marriage, race and education, men earn on average about `r abs(round((exp(model_2$coefficients["AGEP"]) -1) * 100, 2))`% more as age increases between the age of 18 to 64. The premium associated with age is statistically significantly (p < .05).
+ In our subsample of male, predicted earnings increase at a decreasing rate within the age range of our sample, namely, 18 to 64 years. The average age for maximum earnings is `r abs(round(model_2$coefficients["AGEP"]/(2*model_2$coefficients["I(AGEP * AGEP)"]), 2))`.
