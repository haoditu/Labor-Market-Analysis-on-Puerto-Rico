We used data from the 2016 ACS for Puerto Rico to examine wage gaps between individuals with different education levels. Our research questions are:
1) How do earnings vary by education level?
2) How does the premium for education vary by gender?
The 2016 ACS is a nationally representative sample of `r nrow(ss16ppr)`. The household survey includes questions pertaining to each household memberâ€™s demographic characteristics and labor market activity. 

We restrict our sample to these three racial groups: White, Black and Other. In addition, given our goal of examining earning differences by gender and marital status and the reporting of earnings in the ACS on an annual basis (wages, salary, commissions, bonuses, tips, and self-employment income during the past 12 months), we restrict our sample to full-time year-round (FTYR) workers. We define FTYR workers as individuals who report positive earnings over the past year, who worked at least 40 of the past 52 weeks, and who worked at least 35 hours per week in a usual work week over this period. 

## EDA Insights: 

For our exploratory analysis we looked at population breakdowns by education, age,  marital status, gender, race, earnings, and work hours. We applied filters on education (HS diploma or above), age (18-64), and work hours (>35/week). 

An earnings histogram identified a default maximum amount of earnings (189k) which we also filtered out of the data. The earning distribution is progressive above the median, but drops off sharply below the median, likely indicating the presence of a minimum wage. The correlation between age and earnings is very weak (.23). Likewise, earnings is very weakly correlated with hours worked among those who work more than 35 hours per week. However, white individuals appear to have an earnings premium over other races, and both married and divorced individuals appear to have an earnings premium over those who have never been married. Given that the correlation between age and earnings was weak, this may be due to other qualitative factors possessed by those who get married.  Married was recategoried to married, divorced and never married.  Men also appear to earn a small premium over women.

The age distribution of full time workers is skewed towards older adults, possibly indicating that younger workers have trouble finding full-time work, wait to enter the workforce, or are leaving the territory.

## Task 1: 

Examine the first 10 or 20 observations (rows of data) corresponding to variables of interest (columns) and compare the observed values to the data dictionary for person records.

```{r}

ss16ppr1 <- ss16ppr %>% select(c(PERNP, SEX, AGEP, RAC1P, MAR, SCHL, WKW, WKHP)) %>% rename(Earnings = PERNP, Sex = SEX, Age = AGEP, Race =RAC1P, 'Marital Status' = MAR, Education = SCHL, 'Work Week' = WKW, 'Work Hours' = WKHP)
kable(head(ss16ppr1, 20)) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped")
```

## Task 2:

Compute and examine descriptive statistics including the minimum, maximum, mean, and median for quantitative variables of interest

### Total person's earnings

```{r}
ss16ppr$PERNP <- as.numeric(ss16ppr$PERNP)
summary1 <-
  list("Total person's earnings" =
         list("Minimum" = ~ min(.data$PERNP),

              "Median" = ~ median(.data$PERNP),
              "Mean" = ~ mean(.data$PERNP))
  )
### Overall
whole <- summary_table(ss16ppr, summary1)
kable(whole) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped")
```

### Age

```{r}
summary2 <-
  list("Age" =
         list("Minimum" = ~ min(.data$AGEP),
              "Maximum" = ~ max(.data$AGEP),

```

### Race: White

In Puerto Rico, the majority of people identify themselves as white.  Minority races including American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander can be eliminated.

Task 5:

Generate and examine cross tabulations, scatterplots, and/or correlation coefficients of interest

### Age vs. Total person's earnings 

```{r}
ss16ppr <- filter(ss16ppr, PERNP != max(ss16ppr$PERNP))
ggplot(ss16ppr,  aes(AGEP, PERNP)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Age") + ylab("Earnings")

ggplot(ss16ppr) +
  geom_point(aes(AGEP, PERNP), alpha = 1 / 5) +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Age") + ylab("Earnings") +
  facet_grid(SEX ~ .)

ggplot(ss16ppr) +
  geom_point(aes(AGEP, PERNP), alpha = 1 / 5) +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Age") + ylab("Earnings") +
  facet_wrap(SCHL ~ .)

ggplot(ss16ppr) +
  geom_point(aes(AGEP, PERNP), alpha = 1 / 5) +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Age") + ylab("Earnings") +
  facet_wrap(SEX ~ .) 
```

The correlation of `r round(cor(ss16ppr$PERNP, ss16ppr$AGEP),2)` for age and earnings indicates a very weak relationship. Age is neither a primary reason for differences in earnings, nor a clear proxy for some other variable.

### Work hours vs. Total person's earnings 

```{r}
ggplot(ss16ppr,  aes(WKHP, PERNP)) +
  geom_point()  +
  xlab("Work hours") + ylab("Earnings")
```

The correlation of `r round(cor(ss16ppr$PERNP, ss16ppr$WKHP),2)` for earnings and work hours is also very weak. No doubt it would be strong if the data were not filtered to those working more than 35 hours per week. Interestingly, earnings appear to drop for those working more than 60 hours per week.

$Earning = \beta_0 + Divorced * \beta_1 + NeverMarried * \beta_2 + Female * \beta_3 + RaceBlack * \beta_4 + RaceOther * \beta_5 +$ 

$SomeCollege * \beta_6 + Associate * \beta_7 + Bachelor * \beta_8 + Master * \beta_9 + Professional * \beta_10 + Doctoral * \beta_11 + Age * \beta_12$

```{r}
model_1 <- lm(PERNP ~ Divorced + NeverMarried + Female + RaceBlack + RaceOther + SomeCollege + Associate + Bachelor + Master + Professional + Doctoral + AGEP, data = ss16ppr)
summary(model_1)
```



+ Coefficients Explanation 
    + Holding gender, race, education and age constant, married or widowed people make $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["Divorced"], 2))` more than people who are divorced or separated on average.
    + Holding gender, race, education and age constant, married or widowed people make $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["NeverMarried"], 2))` more than people who have never married on average.
    + Holding marriage, race, education and age constant, males make $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["Female"], 2))` more than females on average.
    + Holding marriage, gender, education and age constant, Whites make $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["RaceBlack"], 2))` more than Blacks on average.
    + Holding marriage, gender, education and age constant, Whites make $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["RaceOther"], 2))` more than Other races on average.
    + Holding marriage, gender, race and age constant, people with a high school education make $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["SomeCollege"], 2))` less than people with some college education on average.
    + Holding marriage, gender, race and age constant, people with a high school education make $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["Associate"], 2))` less than people with an associate's degree on average.
    + Holding marriage, gender, race and age constant, people with a high school education make $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["Bachelor"], 2))` less than people with a bachelorâ€™s degree on average.
    + Holding marriage, gender, race and age constant, people with a high school education make $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["Master"], 2))` less than people with a masterâ€™s degree on average.
    + Holding marriage, gender, race and age constant, people with a high school education make $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["Professional"], 2))` less than people with a Professional degree on average.
    + Holding marriage, gender, race and age constant, people with a high school education make $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["Doctoral"], 2))` less than people with a doctorate degree on average.
    + Holding marriage, gender, race and education constant, people make $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["AGEP"], 2))` more per year of age on average between the ages of 18 and 64.



### Second Model:

$Earning = \beta_0 + Female * \beta_1 + SomeCollege * \beta_2 + Associate * \beta_3 + Bachelor * \beta_4 +$

$Master * \beta_5 + Professional * \beta_6 + Doctoral * \beta_7$


```{r}
model_2 <-lm(PERNP ~ Female + SomeCollege + Associate + Bachelor + Master + Professional + Doctoral, data = ss16ppr)
summary(model_2)
```

+ Coefficients Explanation
    + Holding education constant, males make $4656 more than females on average.
    + Holding gender constant, people with a high school education make $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["SomeCollege"], 2))` less than people with some college education on average.
    + Holding gender constant, people with a high school education make $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["Associate"], 2))` less than people with an associate's degree on average.
    + Holding gender constant, people with a high school education make $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["Bachelor"], 2))` less than people with a bachelorâ€™s degree on average.
    + Holding gender constant, people with a high school education make $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["Master"], 2))` less than people with a masterâ€™s degree on average.
    + Holding gender constant, people with a high school education make $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["Professional"], 2))` less than people with a Professional degree on average.
    + Holding gender constant, people with a high school education make $`r abs(round(model_1$coefficients["Doctoral"], 2))` less than people with a doctorate degree on average.
