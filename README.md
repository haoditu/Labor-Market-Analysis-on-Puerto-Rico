# Labor-Market-Analysis-on-Puerto-Rico

# Using multiple linear and non-linear regression model 

We used data from the 2016 ACS for Puerto Rico to examine wage gaps between individuals with different education levels. Our research questions are: 
1) How do earnings vary by education level? 
2) How does the premium for education vary by gender? 
The 2016 ACS is a nationally representative sample of 5194. The household survey includes questions pertaining to each household memberâ€™s demographic characteristics and labor market activity.
